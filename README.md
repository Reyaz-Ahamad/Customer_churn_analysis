# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of customer churn, aiming to identify key factors that influence customer retention using **Python** and popular data visualization libraries like **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze customer churn data to understand the reasons behind customer turnover and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.
- **Data**: Utilizes customer behavior data, including tenure, payment methods, and contract types.

## Key Features
- 🔍 **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Data transformation for better analysis.
  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations of trends and relationships.
  - Insights into features like **tenure**, **contract type**, and **payment methods**.
  - Analysis of customer segments most likely to churn.

- 📈 **Customer Churn Insights**:
  - Correlation between **contract types** and **churn rates**.
  - Identifying high-risk segments using **payment method analysis**, showing that customers using *electronic checks* are more likely to churn.

- 🎨 **Visualization Techniques**:
  - Count plots, bar charts, and histograms for visualizing data.
  - Helps in understanding customer demographics and behaviors through clear graphical representations.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing
